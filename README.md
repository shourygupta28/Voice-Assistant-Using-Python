# Voice-Assistant-Python
I have made a Voice Assistant Using Python which can behave like Jarvis - The A.I. assistant of Iron Man or Google assistant. This assistant can talk to you or communicate with you using your voice and can do a handful of tasks . The project totally depend on the if..else.. conditions which I have written inside the Program.
Here are some tasks this A.I. can perform -:
It can send emails on your behalf.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
It can click your pictures, tell you jokes.
It is capable of shutting down, sleeping, restarting your PC.
